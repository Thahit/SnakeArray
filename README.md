# SnakeArray
I create a snake game with as few imports as possible, using an array as playing field
It is not very userfriendly as the controlls are very clumsy, and might not work sometimes
It is not ment, to be as beautiful as possible

This is how the game starts

this is a Gameplay example

For anyone reading this. Sorry for the spelling mistakes that might be there. It wasn't a priority to me as this is just a project for me to learn how to program.
