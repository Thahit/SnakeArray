# SnakeArray
I create a snake game with as few imports as possible, using an array as playing field. <br>
It is not very userfriendly as the controlls are very clunky, and might not work sometimes. <br>
It is not ment to be as beautiful as possible.

This is how the game starts

this is a Gameplay example

For anyone reading this. Sorry for the spelling mistakes that might be there. It wasn't a priority to me as this is just a project for me to learn how to program.
